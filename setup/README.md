Setup Scripts
==============================================================================

To get started:

- Edit the setup variables in the config file, by default `~/.config/setup/setup.conf`. *OPTIONAL*
- Run this to bootstrap the setup environment:

```sh
bash <(wget -qO - -- 'https://github.com/MestreLion/setup/raw/main/bootstrap.sh')
```

- Run the setup scripts you want: `setup <name>.install`. You can directly run the installers too!

- Have fun!

See the [available installers](setup/) for more information.
The [libraries](setuplib.d/) might be worth taking a look too.
