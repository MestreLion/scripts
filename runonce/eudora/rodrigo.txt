C:\Eudora\eudora.exe daily.msg

'daily.msg' file that contains "To:", "From:", and "Subject:" headers, followed by a blank line then my message body.
The file MUST have the suffix .msg for this to work.

This queues the message up and sends it. Be aware that if Eudora is NOT running, it will start up and stay running.
I originally got this info from:
